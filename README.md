# ClinicalPET_SEG
This repository provides a complete pipeline built on nnU-Net for automated segmentation of tumor lesions from whole-body 2-[18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT scans, followed by extraction of key radiomics and metabolic parameters. It is designed for clinical research, multi-center studies, and large-scale imaging analysis. Processes PET and CT two channels jointly to improve accuracy in tumor boundary delineation and metabolic activity detection.
